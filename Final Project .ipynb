For instance, there are people opening up donut shops in China. Meanwhile, there are Chinese people try to open a Chinese restaurant overseas. A lot of people are targeting at Toronto and New York City.

This project will make comparisons between the two cities, and it will give Chinese people some ideas about where it the better place to open up a Chiense Restaurant.**"
