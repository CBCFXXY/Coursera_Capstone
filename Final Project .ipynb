For instance, there are people opening up donut shops in China. Meanwhile, there are Chinese people try to open Chinese restaurants overseas. A lot of people are targeting at Toronto and New York City. People will like to see which of the city is more competitive so that they could go to the other one to have their businesses settled down. This project will make comparisons between the two cities, and it will give Chinese people some ideas about where it the better place to open up a Chiense Restaurant.**"
